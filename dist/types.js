 *

 * docked AND not cleaning means the robot is probably stuck somewhere — which
 * is why both ship together and why no third "stuck" sensor is guessed at: that
 * one is a timeout over these two, and it belongs in his automation where he
 * can pick the timeout, not in a plugin that would pick it for him.
