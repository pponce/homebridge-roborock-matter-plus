     * cuando se llene el depósito de agua." It is a push notification, not tile
     * decoration (Wazza151 confirmed the same on an a70 in #5), and it repeated
     * every 2 minutes while his robot was set to Vacuum. On a vacuum-only run
     * every word of it is false: the robot is not waiting for water and will not
     * start cleaning when the tank is filled. So this is not a preference about
     * when a warning is welcome — the plugin was asserting a block that did not
     * exist.
     *
     * WHY "VACUUM IS SELECTED" IS NOT THE TEST. `selectedCleanMode` is not
     * persisted: it starts at CLEAN_MODE_VACUUM on every restart (measured 20
     * Aug), so reading it directly would silence the tank warning on every robot
     * until somebody happened to touch the mode picker — quietly undoing the one
     * field-verified thing this attribute does. Only a mode somebody actually
     * said counts: the robot's own report while it is genuinely cleaning, the
     * user's selection outside that. The wind-down is excluded for the same
     * reason getCurrentCleanMode() excludes it — a dock washing a mop runs water
     * with the fan off and on again, which reads as vacuum+mop and is nothing of
     * the sort.
     *
     * WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM getCurrentCleanMode(), because the
     * difference looks like an oversight and is not: there, a Matter selection
     * that has not been applied yet outranks the robot's live report, so the
     * mode picker keeps showing what the user just asked for instead of
     * flickering back. Here it does not. A selection made mid-run is not applied
     * mid-run — the prep only runs before a start — so the robot carries on with
     * the water it already had, and a robot physically mopping with an empty
     * tank is blocked no matter what the picker shows. The picker reports
     * intent; this reports what is happening to the floor.
     *
     * The derived type goes through acceptLiveCleanType() like every other
     * consumer of it, and that gate is right here for the same reason it is
     * right there: a robot whose water this plugin has already turned off and
     * had acknowledged is not using water, however long its own report takes to
     * agree. Announcing a block during that window would be the lag talking.
     *
     * The HAP `Water Tank Empty` sensor is deliberately NOT gated by this. It

     * The Matter run mode to publish.
     *
     * Apple Home treats RvcRunMode as the answer to "is this robot cleaning?":
     * it announces a cleaning that started when the mode goes to Cleaning and
     * one that finished when it goes back to Idle. A dock chore is neither.
     * Emptying the dust bin while the robot sat idle in its dock published
     * Cleaning and then Idle again, so the dock's own housekeeping announced a
     * cleaning that never happened (issue #9, Q Revo). The mirror image matters
     * just as much: a robot that empties its bin in the MIDDLE of a run must not
     * announce that the run finished and started again.
     *
     * So a dock chore inherits the run mode that was published before it began,
     * instead of deciding one of its own. Transit does the same, and for the same
     * reason: after the dock empties the bin the robot reports "returning to
     * dock" for about a second before it charges again, and publishing Cleaning
     * for that blip announced a second cleaning that started and finished from a
     * robot that never moved (issue #9, the reporter's follow-up). Driving home
     * is how a real run ENDS, never how one begins.
     *
     * Both are recognised from the robot's own state, not from the
     * controller-facing one: with "Extended Operational States" off, emptying
     * the dust bin is rewritten to RUNNING one level below and seeking the
     * charger to STOPPED, so reading that would leave the rule working only for
     * the users who enabled the toggle — which is exactly how the transit blip
     * survived 3.6.2 and reached the field. The toggle decides how a state is
     * displayed; it never decides whether a cleaning happened.

     * So `currentArea` stays null: no room is named that we are not sure of.
     *
     * The scope is published as OPERATING rather than PENDING, and that choice
     * is the whole point of this function, so it is worth writing down why.
     *
     * Matter has 4 progress values and none of them means "in this run, exact
     * position unknown". Both available encodings are therefore imperfect:
     * every area operating asserts the robot is in all of them, every area
     * pending asserts it is in none of them. The second is the one that reads
     * as a bug, because Apple Home renders "nothing is operating" as *the robot
     * is still on its way* — "Traveling to Room", "heading to the room",
     * "Desplazándose" — and keeps saying it for the entire run while the robot
     * is demonstrably cleaning.
     *
     * 2.3.1 already tried the honest-looking option. It moved a full clean from
     * an empty list to an all-pending list hoping Apple's label would improve,
     * and said out loud that whether it did was up to Apple's renderer. It did
     * not: skmzwanke reported the stuck label in #8, and vp-debug12 reported
     * exactly the same thing in #9 months and many versions later, in Spanish.
     * 2 independent users, one unchanged symptom, one failed mitigation.
     *
     * So this picks the encoding that produces the true statement at the only
     * place a person looks. The robot IS operating; it is not on its way. Live
     * map-position tracking still collapses this to the accurate single-room
     * picture the moment it resolves a room, and the run still flips wholly to
     * completed when the robot returns to the charger.

     * Whether the robot is in its dock.
     *
     * charge_status is a TIEBREAKER for a state that does not answer the
     * question, never an override of one that does. It used to be an independent
     * sufficient condition (`|| !!chargeStatus`), which contradicted the rule
     * this file already applies one function below: getRoborockOperationalState()
     * consults charge_status only in its `default:` arm — a robot reporting
     * state 5 is RUNNING no matter what charge_status says.
     *
     * The two fields are not read at the same instant. A sparse live frame
     * carrying only dps 121 moves `state` while `charge_status` keeps whatever it
     * held before the robot left its dock, and getNumberStatus() falls back to
     * the slower HomeData snapshot for any field the live frame omits. So the
     * pair "state = Room Clean, charge_status = 1" is not a contradiction in the
     * robot; it is one fresh field beside one stale one, and letting the stale
     * one win made the plugin call a robot mid-run docked.
     *
     * Measured in issue #8 on a Saros 10, twice out of two attempts on different
     * versions: the plugin published operationalState=1 for eight minutes with a
     * falling battery and live room tracking moving between rooms, and still
     * logged "despite a docked snapshot" when the run was ended from Apple Home.
     * The log line was the visible half. The costly half was shouldRetryReturnToDock(),
     * which asks this first and gave up before it reached
     * isRoborockActivelyCleaningAwayFromDock() — so the dock-retry never armed for
     * exactly the robots whose charge_status lags.
     *
     * Reuses that predicate rather than listing the states again: a second
     * hand-written copy of a list is the most repeated defect in this codebase.
