// Matter's robot vacuum device type has no water-tank attribute of any kind.
// Two releases tried to say it through the fault attribute instead and both
// came back out — 1.4.61 and 3.4.1 — after four controlled tests on an S8 Pro
// Ultra with a genuinely empty tank produced no warning in Apple Home at all.
// So the tile is not a route, and a HAP contact sensor is the whole of it.
//
// What makes this sensor different from "docked" and "cleaning" is that the
// robots disagree about how they say it. Both of these were measured with the
// tank physically empty:
//
//   a70  S8 Pro Ultra  issue #5   dock_error_status 38, water_shortage_status 0
//   a75  Q Revo        issue #9   dock_error_status 38, water_shortage_status 1
//
// Wazza151 emptied and refilled his tank and watched dock_error_status track
// it; vp-debug12 confirmed his was empty while both fields were set. The a70's
// zero is the reason this is an OR and not a preference order — reading the
// shortage flag first and trusting its 0 would report a full tank on the very
// robot the condition was field-measured on.
//
// The tests enumerate the rule rather than those two rows: any field
// combination, any dock error code, and the resting state of every sensor in
// the registry rather than of this one.
