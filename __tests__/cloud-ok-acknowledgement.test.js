// "ok". So the branch that was supposed to fire only for secure requests
// (get_map_v1, whose real payload comes on protocol 301) instead swallowed the
// completion of every normal command: app_start, app_stop, app_pause,
// app_charge, set_custom_mode, app_segment_clean. Those sat until the 10 s
// request timeout and then failed in Apple Home — while the robot had already
// done exactly what was asked.
