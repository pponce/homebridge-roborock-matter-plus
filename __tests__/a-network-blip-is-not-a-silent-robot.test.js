/**
 * 3.30.0 added a register that stops asking a robot a request it never
 * answers, and documented — in the source and in the log line the user
 * reads — that it "never trips on a transport error, because those come back
 * on their own".
 *
 * It did. The exclusion was dead code.
 *
 * `messageQueueHandler` builds the two timeout messages with the connection
 * state interpolated as a BOOLEAN:
 *
 *   `… timed out after 10 seconds. MQTT connection state: ${mqttConnectionState}`
 *   `… timed out after 10 seconds Local connect state: ${localConnectionState}`
 *
 * so a link that was down reads "MQTT connection state: false" — which
 * matches none of EAI_AGAIN / ENOTFOUND / ECONNREFUSED / ECONNRESET /
 * "not connected" / "offline". Every one of those names belongs to an error
 * shape that never contains "timed out after" in the first place, so the
 * first gate had already excluded them and the second gate had nothing left
 * to do.
 *
 * Consequence: a four-minute network blip during a clean produces six
 * consecutive timeouts on a 10-second live-room poll, the breaker opens, and
 * live-room tracking dies for six hours — under a log line telling the user
 * this was "not a connection failure".
 *
 * These tests use the EXACT strings the plugin emits. That is the whole
 * point: the 3.30.0 tests used hand-written messages the code cannot
 * produce, which is why they passed against a broken rule.
