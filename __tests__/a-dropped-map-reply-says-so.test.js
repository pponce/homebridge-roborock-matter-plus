/**
 * THE OLDEST OPEN BUG IN THIS PROJECT, and why nobody could diagnose it.
 *
 * `get_map_v1` on a classic robot times out after 10 seconds, forever, while
 * the same robot answers everything else: 95 consecutive failures on my own
 * a70 (225 twelve days earlier), 40 on the a75 in #9.
 *
 * Map replies do not come back on the ordinary reply path. They arrive as
 * protocol 301 frames, and the 301 handler had several ways to drop one, all
 * of them a bare `return` — no log, no counter, nothing. A dropped 301 leaves
 * the pending request to die on its timer, which is indistinguishable from a
 * robot that never answered. That is why this was never diagnosed: there was
 * nothing to diagnose it WITH.
 *
 * One of those drops was also wrong. The endpoint guard read
 *
 *     if (!endpoint.startsWith(data2.endpoint)) return;
 *
 * where `endpoint` is our own 8-character key and `data2.endpoint` is a
 * 15-byte wire field with only TRAILING nulls stripped. python-roborock, the
 * reference implementation, compares it the other way round —
 * `received.startswith(ours)`. As written, any byte after our 8 characters
 * that is not a trailing null makes the received string longer than 8, and an
 * 8-character string can never `startsWith` a longer one. It failed closed,
 * on a reply addressed to us, in silence.
 *
 * These tests do not claim this IS the cause of the a70 timeouts — that is a
 * measurement the next clean will make, now that the drop says so. They pin
 * the comparison against the reference implementation, and that no path drops
 * a 301 without saying why.
